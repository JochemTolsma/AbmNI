# AbmNI

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AbmNI is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of AbmNI from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JochemTolsma/AbmNI")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(AbmNI)
library(plotly)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(23455)
```

### Generating some toy data
```{r}
seeds <- sample(2345:34567, 1000, replace=FALSE) #CAUTION, DO NOT OVERWRITE IF YOU WANT TO REPLICATE RUNS
#opinions <- seq(-1 ,1, length.out=10)
#opinions <- round(runif(10, min=-1, max=1), 1)
opinions <- c( -0.1 , 1.0 , 0.4 , 0.4 ,-0.5 , 0.4 , 0.7 , 0.7 ,-0.3,  0.6)
#groups <- rep(c(-1,1), 5 )
groups <- c(-1,  1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1,  1)
net1 <- matrix(sample(c(0,1),100, replace=TRUE), nrow=10, ncol =10)
diag(net1) <- 0
```

### simulations 
Lets do 50 simulations.
Only the opinions matter in the dissimilarity scores. Thus, H=1. 
```{r}
nsim <- 50
results <- list()
for (i in 1:nsim) {
  #NOTE: IF MANY RUNS SET KEEP TO FALSE AND VERBOSE TO FALSE
  results[[i]] <- ABM_NI(opinions=opinions, groups=groups, iter=1000, keep=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, seed = seeds[i], H = 1)
}
```

### results  
Retrieve the results. 
First have a look at how many runs polarized. We use the sd as indicator of polarization. 
```{r}
df_sd <- do.call("rbind", lapply(results, FUN = function(x) x[[1]]$sd))
table(round(df_sd,1))
```
So it seems we have four different type of outcomes. 
Let us have a look at the opinions in the end: 

```{r}
df_opinions <- do.call("rbind", lapply(results, FUN = function(x) x[[1]]$opinions))
print("consensus")
df_opinions[round(df_sd,1) == 0, ][1,] #consensus (check if also consensus at extreme!)

print("all extreme, 1 outlier extremist")
df_opinions[round(df_sd,1) == 0.6, ][1,] 

print("all extreme, 2 outlier extremist")
df_opinions[round(df_sd,1) == 0.8, ][1,] 

print("all extreme, 3 outlier extremist: polarization")
df_opinions[round(df_sd,1) == 1, ][1,] 
```
### rerun specific simulations

Check out run 1
```{r}
#thus rerun with same seed
results <- ABM_NI(opinions=opinions, groups=groups, iter=200, verbose=FALSE, seed = seeds[1], H = 1, keep=TRUE)
df_opinions <- do.call("rbind", lapply(results, FUN = function(x) x$opinions))
df_opinions <- round(df_opinions, 1)

#plot development
matres <- matrix(NA, nrow=200, ncol=length(seq(-1, 1, 0.1)))
for (i in 1:200) {
  op <- factor(df_opinions[i,], levels = seq(-1, 1, 0.1))
  prop <- prop.table(table(op)) #relative frequency across all possible values
  matres[i,] <- prop
}

time <- 1:200 #check the iter argument of ABM_NI
opinion <- seq(-1, 1, 0.1)

# Create surface plot
p <- plot_ly(x = time, y = opinion, z = t(matres), type = "surface") |> 
  layout(title = 'Relative frequency of opinions',
         scene = list(camera=list(eye = list(x=-2, y=-0.5, z=0.64))))
#naturally the interactive plot is much nicer, but does not work in README :-(

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./Image1.png")
```

Check out run 2
```{r}
#thus rerun with same seed
results <- ABM_NI(opinions=opinions, groups=groups, iter=200, verbose=FALSE, seed = seeds[2], H = 1, keep=TRUE)
df_opinions <- do.call("rbind", lapply(results, FUN = function(x) x$opinions))
df_opinions <- round(df_opinions, 1)

#plot development
matres <- matrix(NA, nrow=200, ncol=length(seq(-1, 1, 0.1)))
for (i in 1:200) {
  op <- factor(df_opinions[i,], levels = seq(-1, 1, 0.1))
  prop <- prop.table(table(op)) #relative frequency across all possible values
  matres[i,] <- prop
}

time <- 1:200 #check the iter argument of ABM_NI
opinion <- seq(-1, 1, 0.1)

# Create surface plot
p <- plot_ly(x = time, y = opinion, z = t(matres), type = "surface") |>
  layout(title = 'Relative frequency of opinions',
         scene = list(camera=list(eye = list(x=-2, y=-0.5, z=0.64))),
         legend = list(
          xaxis = list(title = 'time')  
         ))
          
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./Image2.png")
```

# Example 2

Put egos in a queue. 

Lets do 50 simulations.
Only the opinions matter in the dissimilarity scores. Thus, H=1.

```{r}
nsim <- 50
results <- list()
#because we now iterate over the queue, trim down the iter. 
for (i in 1:nsim) {
  #NOTE: IF MANY RUNS SET KEEP TO FALSE AND VERBOSE TO FALSE
  results[[i]] <- ABM_NI(opinions=opinions, selectType=2, groups=groups, iter=100, keep=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, seed = seeds[i], H = 1)
}
```

### results  
Retrieve the results. 
First have a look at how many runs polarized. We use the sd as indicator of polarization. 
```{r}
df_sd <- do.call("rbind", lapply(results, FUN = function(x) x[[1]]$sd))
table(round(df_sd,1))
```
random ego selection or putting in a waiting line, does not seem to matter

# Example 3

weights also determined by group. 

```{r}
cor.test(opinions, groups)
```
We see a moderate correlation between opinions and groups. thus polarization should become more likely. 

```{r}
nsim <- 50
results <- list()
for (i in 1:nsim) {
  #NOTE: IF MANY RUNS SET KEEP TO FALSE AND VERBOSE TO FALSE
  results[[i]] <- ABM_NI(opinions=opinions, groups=groups, iter=1000, keep=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, seed = seeds[i], H = 0.5)
}
```

### results  
```{r}
df_sd <- do.call("rbind", lapply(results, FUN = function(x) x[[1]]$sd))
table(round(df_sd,1))
```
All maximum polarization. Lets have a better look! 

Do we see alignment?

```{r}
results <- ABM_NI(opinions=opinions, groups=groups, iter=200, verbose=FALSE, seed = seeds[15], H = 0.5, keep=TRUE)
df_opinions <- do.call("rbind", lapply(results, FUN = function(x) x$opinions))
df_opinions <- round(df_opinions, 1)

cors <- NA
for (i in 1:200) {
  cors[i] <- cor(groups, df_opinions[i,])
}
plot(1:200, cors)

```

Yup!


<!---
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
